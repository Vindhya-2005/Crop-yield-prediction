# Crop-yield-prediction
"Machine learning–based system that predicts crop yield and expected revenue using agricultural and economic data such as rainfall, irrigation, and Minimum Support Price (MSP). 
This helps farmers and policymakers estimate productivity and income trends for better decision-making."

Project Overview:
The project forecasts crop yield (kg/ha) and expected revenue for various crops across Indian districts.
It uses environmental features such as rainfall, irrigation, cropping intensity, and net sown area.
MSP data is integrated to compute the potential revenue based on government-supported prices.
The trained model can assist in agricultural planning and income estimation.

Features:
Predicts crop yield using a trained Random Forest regression model.
Calculates total production and revenue based on MSP values.
Supports multiple crops, districts, and years.
Uses clean and preprocessed agricultural datasets.
Provides interactive user input for crop, district, month, and year.
